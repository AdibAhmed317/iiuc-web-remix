In the name of Allah - the most Beneficent, the most Merciful International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) was established in 1995 by the Islamic University Chittagong Trust (IUCT) with a mission of developing this university as an ideal institution of higher learning and research in the private sector of Bangladesh. IUC Trust and its Syndicate are being run by academic scholars and leaders of international repute, consisting of scholars from home and abroad. The vision of IIUC is to combine quality education with morality so that the graduates of this university grow up with skill-based modern knowledge and strong morality for humanness. In the higher education sector of Bangladesh, IIUC has already established itself as a forerunner of addressing the challenges of globalization by providing appropriate knowledge imbued with morality in order to bring peace, progress and tranquility in human societies across the globe.

Over the past years of its establishment, development and expansion, it has cut an image of one of the best ranking private universities in Bangladesh. And this is because of the fact that IIUC has qualified faculties in all the departments having sufficient library, lab and internet facilities. Currently IIUC has more than one lac fifty thousands books in its central library along with five thousand e-journals and each faculty has its seminar library with required books and journals. A good number of IIUC graduates have obtained higher degrees from foreign universities which is the testimony of its best quality education. Many graduates of this university are being employed within the country and outside and are holding important positions both in private and public sectors. A few graduates of IIUC are also recruited in the teaching and non-teaching positions of public universities. One of the unique features of IIUC is that it is providing separate education to male and female students. Moreover, IIUC has developed its 40 acres Permanent Campus at Kumira (Sitakunda) – 22 km off Chittagong City and situated beside the Dhaka-Chittagong highway in a hilly area with required modern facilities and in a beautiful landscape with thin forest bounties.

I expect that the students of IIUC will try their best to take the fullest advantage of this university, by freely interacting with teachers and officials of IIUC which has already become their chosen institution of higher learning and research.

May Allah help us all.

It aims at revivification of the pursuit of science, both physical and social, together with the pursuit of Islamic theological lore with a view to uplifting moral, intellectual and natural aspects of life of the humankind.
